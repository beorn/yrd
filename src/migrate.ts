/**
 * journal.jsonl v1 → v2, one-shot (spec § event schema v2, "the journal
 * migration"). v1 rows are the pre-v0.3 dotted event names — `{v, ts, actor,
 * type, pr?, lease?, data?}`. v2 rows are the slash-namespaced families —
 * `{id, ts, name, cause, data}` (docs/events.md). There is no dual-read shim:
 * a v1 journal must be migrated before any v0.3 code reads it, and this file
 * is the only place that still knows the v1 shape.
 *
 * Renames (docs/events.md § event families):
 *   bay.initialized      → gitbay/initialized
 *   audit.completed       → gitbay/audited
 *   lease.opened          → bay/opened            (+ worktree/provisioned's sibling data)
 *   lease.pinged          → bay/refreshed
 *   lease.ended           → bay/closed            (endReason → via)
 *   workspace.provisioned → worktree/provisioned
 *   workspace.retired     → worktree/deprovisioned (via inherited from the lease's last bay/closed)
 *   pr.opened             → pr/opened             (via inferred: "push" iff a lease pre-minted this PR)
 *   pr.state-changed       → pr/changed            (rejected rows get a code inferred from `detail`)
 *   queue.reordered        → queue/reordered       (payload 1:1)
 *   batch.composed         → line/batch/started    (the 20955-20957 batch dialect; compose-only rows gain
 *                                                    empty ejected/prefixes — a later built row completes the fold)
 *   batch.built            → line/batch/started    (payload 1:1 + empty skipped)
 *   batch.bisect.checked   → line/step/finished    (step "check", role "prefix")
 *   batch.member.ejected   → line/batch/isolated   (outcome "ejected"; reason inferred from detail)
 * (The interim batch/* slash names — composed/built/bisect-checked/
 * member-ejected/bisect-refused/settled — existed only between 20955 and the
 * 21000 line/* migration and never reached any surviving journal; verified
 * zero rows in the one production journal, so nothing reads or migrates them.)
 * Dropped (non-events; docs/events.md § event families: "an empty integrate
 * run, a prune that removed nothing" are deliberately never journaled):
 *   queue.empty, gc.clean, batch.empty
 * Absorbed, not replayed (adopt.recorded added no field pr/opened doesn't
 * already carry once `via` exists):
 *   adopt.recorded
 *
 * PR state vocabulary (docs/model.md — the pre-v0.3 AND v0.3-through-v0.6
 * journals share the SAME three renamed names, so one pass covers both;
 * this is effectively v1→v3 for `pr/changed`'s `from`/`to`, even though the
 * envelope shape itself is still v2):
 *   open      → pushed
 *   queued    → submitted
 *   abandoned → closed
 * `checking`/`merging`/`merged`/`rejected` are unchanged; `checked` is a
 * BRAND NEW resting state no v1/v2 journal ever produced, so no migrated row
 * ever needs to become it — see renamePrState().
